            <h3>Slugga</h3>
            <img class="gunz1" src="Slugga.png">
            <p>A Slugga is the Ork equivalent of a Space Marine Bolt Pistol. It is usually paired with a Choppa, and mobs of
                Boyz who carry the two are called Slugga Boyz. Due to the ramshackle nature of Ork weaponry, every Slugga
                is different, but most if not all Sluggas are semi-automatic, large calibre side arms. Though not as sophisticated
                as most other weapons used in the Imperium, Sluggas are no less effective than other, more advanced side
                arms when used correctly. As far as the melee-focused Ork holding it is concerned, the effectiveness of a
                Slugga is of little importance, as long as it is big and makes a loud noise when it fires.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Shoota</h3>
            <img class="gunz1" src="Shoota.jpg">
            <p>Shootas are the Ork equivalent to Space Marine Bolters. Essentially a machine gun (most even look like early
                World War I machine guns), the Shoota is the weapon any Ork looks at getting when he wants "moar dakka".
                Mobs of Slugga Boyz will often have a few Boyz armed with Shootas to add a little extra sting, but entire
                mobs of Shoota Boyz are also common; footslogging across the field sending torrents of bullets at any enemy
                in range. An Ork mob may trade in their Sluggas and Choppas for a Shoota if the technology and materials
                are available.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Big Shoota</h3>
            <img class="gunz1" src="bigShoota.jpg">
            <p>A Big Shoota is a loud, heavy, large-calibre machine gun that bucks and sparks like crazy when the trigger is
                pulled. Big Shootas are usually bolted on vehicles - from Grot Tanks to Stompas for anti-personnel support,
                but sometimes a Shoota Boy manages to acquire a big shoota that gives his mob some real anti-infantry power,
                causing envy among other Boys. Big shootas are fed from chunky magazines of ammo by crank handles, motors
                or some other clever mechanisms. They are often "kustomized" to have multiple barrels, big crosshair sights,
                longer ammo belts and such.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Deffgun</h3>
            <img class="gunz1" src="deffGunz.jpg">
            <p>Deffguns are heavy Ork weapons, fine examples of the Mek's craft that are made from all kinds of materials, mainly
                scavenged heavy weaponry of other races. Deffguns are so large they must be mounted on a special firing rig
                strapped to to an Ork's broad shoulders. No man could hope to fit into a Deffgun's rig without heavy augmetics
                or thick slabs of vat-grown muscle. This cumbersome rig is needed to absorb bone-breaking recoil each time
                the Deffgun is fired.</p>

            <h3>Kustom Mega-slugga</h3>
            <img class="gunz1" src="kmslugga.jpg">
            <p>Kustom Mega Slugga is an experimental energy weapon, essentually a pistol-sized version of Kustom Mega-Blasta,
                sometimes used by Ork Mekboys. Watch out for these kustom job, many have lost their own arms from miss firing.
                Melts through nearly anything around.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Kustom Mega-blasta</h3>
            <img class="gunz1" src="kmBlasta.jpg">
            <p>Ork Mekboys sometimes build a weapon that is far greater than the sum of its parts, a marvel of Ork technology
                that fires a focused blast of pure energy at its targets. Known as Kustom Mega-Blasta, it instantly vaporises
                targets even if they wear terminator armour. Needless to say, it is also highly effective against vehicles.
                However, like many Ork weapons, a Kustom Mega-Blasta is very unreliable and prone to overheating. It can
                even kill the greenskin after a particularly unlucky shot. The weapon is mainly used by Ork Mekboys, but
                it is sometimes mounted on Deff Dreads, Killa Kans, Grot Tanks or Mekboy Junkas.</p>

            <h3>Snazzgun</h3>
            <img class="gunz1" src="snazzgun.png">
            <p>A Snazzgun is either a ballistic or directed energy weapon favoured by the most ostentatious and obnoxious of
                Orks, known as Flash Gitz. Snazzguns vary as much in design as Shootas, but all are lethal in the extreme.
                Many Flash Gitz hard-wire their Snazzguns to their primitive bionics, incorporating a variety of barrels,
                scopes and targeting arrays into their cybernetics to maximise their Snazzgun's effectiveness -- not that
                this necessarily makes them any better shots, but it does make them feel bigger and cleverer as they are
                shooting. An individual Snazzgun shoots either bolts of energy or ballistic rounds, but not both. A Snazzgun,
                just like a Shoota, is inherently inaccurate and can do variable damage, as the velocity of its shots (if
                the weapon is of the ballistic variety) can vary.</p>

            <h3>hokk Attack Gun</h3>
            <img class="gunz1" src="sAGunun.jpg">
            <p>No one knows exactly how it does it, but the Shokk Attack Gun projects a narrow forcefield through the Warp,
                beginning at the end of the barrel and ending roughly where the gun is aimed. The portals look like small
                spinning black holes. In this way it is possible for living creatures to travel through the warp towards
                the exit point.</p>
