        <h2>"Everywhere Mankind has travelled, there too are the Orks. They infest this galaxy, and no doubt others, like the
            crude parasites they are. My only hope is that they kill one another before they kill us." â€” Watch Captain Evangelos,
            Deathwatch
        </h2>
        <p>The WAAAGH! is the name given by the Orks themselves to the massive military campaigns they periodically unleash
            on the galaxy as part of their eternal desire to seek out combat and war. The term also applies to the key concept
            of Ork "kultur" around which the entire Greenskin society, if it can be called that, revolves. Barbaric and savage,
            the Greenskins spread across the galaxy like a viridian stain. They plague the battlefields of the 41st Millennium
            in great numbers, overrunning any who stand before them in a torrent of bloodshed and usually mindless violence.
            An Ork WAAAGH! is war on an apocalyptic scale. Orks beyond counting swarm from one world to the next. Whole civilisations
            are exterminated and defenders' armies laid to waste as the Orks plough ever onward in an unstoppable tide. Orks
            need battle just as humans need food and drink. Due to their warlike nature, they constantly fight amongst themselves,
            or launch piratical raids upon nearby enemies. Such conflicts tend to be small-scale or localised. They never
            really develop beyond random outbursts of violence and looting. However, Ork populations can reach a critical
            mass that leads to a full-scale planetary migration. This is known as a WAAAGH!, a crusade of pure aggression
            that crashes through star systems in an orgy of violence.
        </p>
        <p>Ork behaviour is dominated by the WAAAGH!, which is also the name given to the gestalt psychic field the Greenskins
            generate that affects the Ork psyche, which allows Orks to instinctively recognize who is "bigga", and therefore
            who is in charge, since might makes right in Ork society. All Orks generate this field, and it grows stronger
            as the Orks enjoy themselves, generally while fighting, and as more of them congregate together in one geographical
            area. The WAAAGH! helps give momentum to the Orks' planetary assault campaigns, which are also known as WAAAGHs!
            (the Orks like to call a lot of things WAAAGH!s). Such a WAAAGH! is a cross between a holy crusade and a pub
            crawl, with a bit of genocide thrown in for good measure. Thousands of Orks will gather together, drawn to the
            power of a single dominant Ork called a Warboss or Warlord if the WAAAGH! is particularly massive, who is bigger
            and more intelligent than the Orks around him. Then the Orks will set off to find an enemy to fight and defeat.
            Ork WAAAGHs! will sweep whole planetary systems away and destroy armies and fleets in tides of bloodlust and
            carnage, and only once the Orks have killed every available enemy will they start to fight amongst themselves
            again.
        </p>
        <p>The Imperium of Man's Tech-priests have theorized that this gestalt psychic field also has a telekinetic or quantum
            probabilistic effect, allowing the seemingly ramshackle and poorly designed Ork technology to work as the Greenskins
            expect. It is believed that the reason this hypothesis came into existence is that the Imperium adopted the Adeptus
            Mechanicus' religious belief that aspects of a universal "Machine Spirit" inhabits all technology, and that this
            Machine Spirit serves Mankind at the command of the Machine God. If this is the case, without a Machine Spirit,
            Ork machines could not work, requiring some psychic cause to justify their often devastating effect. Furthermore,
            Mechanicus Genetor Lukas Anzion has noted that many Ork-built weapons will not function at all unless wielded
            by an Orkoid, possibly supporting this hypothesis.
