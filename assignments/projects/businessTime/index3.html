        <h2>Simple melee</h2>
        <div>Choppa
            <p>A Slugga is the Ork equivalent of a Space Marine Bolt Pistol. It is usually paired with a Choppa, and mobs of
                Boyz who carry the two are called Slugga Boyz. Due to the ramshackle nature of Ork weaponry, every Slugga
                is different, but most if not all Sluggas are semi-automatic, large calibre side arms. Though not as sophisticated
                as most other weapons used in the Imperium, Sluggas are no less effective than other, more advanced side
                arms when used correctly. As far as the melee-focused Ork holding it is concerned, the effectiveness of a
                Slugga is of little importance, as long as it is big and makes a loud noise when it fires.</p>
        </div>
        <div>Big Choppa
            <p>Shootas are the Ork equivalent to Space Marine Bolters. Essentially a machine gun (most even look like early
                World War I machine guns), the Shoota is the weapon any Ork looks at getting when he wants "moar dakka".
                Mobs of Slugga Boyz will often have a few Boyz armed with Shootas to add a little extra sting, but entire
                mobs of Shoota Boyz are also common; footslogging across the field sending torrents of bullets at any enemy
                in range. An Ork mob may trade in their Sluggas and Choppas for a Shoota if the technology and materials
                are available.</p>

        <h2>Mek-made Melee</h2>
        <div>Killsaw
            <p>Kustom Mega Slugga is an experimental energy weapon, essentually a pistol-sized version of Kustom Mega-Blasta,
                sometimes used by Ork Mekboys.</p>
        </div>
        <div>Powerklaw
            <p>Ork Mekboys sometimes build a weapon that is far greater than the sum of its parts, a marvel of Ork technology
                that fires a focused blast of pure energy at its targets. Known as Kustom Mega-Blasta, it instantly vaporises
                targets even if they wear terminator armour. Needless to say, it is also highly effective against vehicles.
                However, like many Ork weapons, a Kustom Mega-Blasta is very unreliable and prone to overheating. It can
                even kill the greenskin after a particularly unlucky shot. The weapon is mainly used by Ork Mekboys, but
                it is sometimes mounted on Deff Dreads, Killa Kans, Grot Tanks or Mekboy Junkas.</p>
